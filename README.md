The "W Charge Asymmetry Analysis" project is a comprehensive exploration into the intriguing world of charge asymmetry in the decays of W bosons. W bosons, known for their pivotal role in electroweak interactions, can decay into charged leptons and neutrinos, resulting in W+ and W- bosons with differing charge properties. This analysis focuses on understanding and quantifying the charge asymmetry in the leptonic decays of W+ and W- bosons.

## Objectives

1. **Data Set Acquisition**: Find a suitable dataset on CMS OpenData that contains information about $W^{+/-}$ candidates.

2. **Data Validation**: Calculate the Z Boson Invariant mass as an initial step to validate the accuracy of the data and ensure that it is accessed correctly.

3. **Invariant Mass Computation**: Calculate the invariant mass of $W^{+/-}$ bosons, a fundamental quantity in particle physics analysis, to understand their properties and characteristics.

4. **Charge Asymmetry Analysis**: Determine the charge asymmetry ratios between $W^{+}$ and $W^{-}$ boson decays, with a focus on leptonic decays involving charged leptons and neutrinos.
