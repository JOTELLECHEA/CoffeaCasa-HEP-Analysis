## Asymmetry Analysis for the $W^{+/-}$ ratio.

This project will calulate the ratio of $W^+$ and $W^-$. The focus will be on leptonic decays from either $W^+$ and $W^-$.
The W Bosons decay as follows (l = electron or muon): $W^- \rightarrow l^- + v_l$ and $W^+ \rightarrow l^+ + \bar{v_l}$.

Steps that will take:

1. Calculating the Z Boson Invariant mass. (This is to enusre we are accesing the data correctly).
2. Find a data set on CMS Opendata for $W^{+/-}$ canidates.
3. Calculate the invariant mass of $W^{+/-}$.
4. Calculate the ratios of $W^{+/-}$.
